Copy the script code to your R environment or R file.

Make sure to provide the correct paths to the PFAM, SMART, and SUPERFAMILY data files in the code. Update the file paths in the following code sections:

R
Copy code
PFAM <- read_delim("path_to_PFAM_file", "\t", escape_double = FALSE, trim_ws = TRUE)
SMART <- read_delim("path_to_SMART_file", "\t", escape_double = FALSE, trim_ws = TRUE)
SUPERFAMILY <- read_delim("path_to_SUPERFAMILY_file", "\t", escape_double = FALSE, trim_ws = TRUE)
Usage
Ensure you have the correct data files in the provided paths.

Run the code in R or RStudio.

The polar bar charts will be generated and displayed.

The charts will also be saved as an image file named "Fig4.png" in the current directory.

# Annotation-genome-graphics

## Installation
Install the necessary libraries by running the following command in R:

#
install.packages(c("plotly", "readr", "ggplot2", "grid", "gridExtra"))

# Make sure to provide the correct paths to the PFAM, SMART, and SUPERFAMILY data files in the code. Update the file paths in the following code sections:

R

PFAM <- read_delim("path_to_PFAM_file", "\t", escape_double = FALSE, trim_ws = TRUE)
SMART <- read_delim("path_to_SMART_file", "\t", escape_double = FALSE, trim_ws = TRUE)
SUPERFAMILY <- read_delim("path_to_SUPERFAMILY_file", "\t", escape_double = FALSE, trim_ws = TRUE)

## Usage

Run the code in R or RStudio.

The polar bar charts will be generated and displayed.

The charts will also be saved as an image file named "Fig4.png" in the current directory.
